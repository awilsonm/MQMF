Description: Provides R functions for use with the new book: Using R for 
    Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries, being published in
    2020 by Chapman & Hall in their Using R series.  The package 
    provides numerous functions and data-sets required to either 
    run or support the practical examples presented in the book. The 
    integral help for each function describes how those functions can be 
    used to implement the examples contained in Using R for Modelling 
    and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries.
