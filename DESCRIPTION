Description: Provides R functions for use with the new book: Using R for 
    Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries.  The package 
    provides numerous functions and data-sets required to either 
    run or support the practical examples presented in the book. The 
    integral help for each function describes how those functions can be 
    used to implement the URMQMF examples. All examples have been run
    and tested. The chapter r-code chunks are now included as chapter2, 
    chapter3, ..., chapter7 functions, which are empty except for the 
    help pages.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
