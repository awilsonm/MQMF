Description: Provides R functions for use with the book "Using R for 
    Modelling and Quantative Methods in Fisheries" (URMQMF).  The 
    package provides numerous functions and data-sets required to either 
    run or support the practical examples presented in the book. The 
    integral help for each function describes how those functions can be 
    used to implement the URMQMF examples. There are many similarities 
    between this new book and "Modelling and Quantitative Methods in 
    Fisheries" Haddon (2011) <ISBN: 9781584885610>, however, URMQMF 
    often goes beyond the examples in that original book, although does 
    not include details on age-structured models or length-based models.
