Description: Provides R functions that enable the abbreviated and translated
    version of the book Modelling and Quantative Methods in Fisheries 
    (Haddon, 2011) to be run in R. The new book will be called 
    Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries using R. 
    The package provides numerous 
    functions and data-sets required to either run or support the 
    practical examples.  The integral help for each function describes 
    how those functions can be used to implement the MQMF examples. 
    MQMF often goes beyond the examples in the original book, but does 
    not include the chapters on the more advanced subjects, such as 
    age-structured models and length-based models.
