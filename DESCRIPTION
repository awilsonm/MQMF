Description: Provides R functions for use with the book: Using R for 
    Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries (URMQMF).  The 
    package provide numerous functions and data-sets required to either 
    run or support the practical examples presented in the book. The 
    integral help for each function describes how those functions can be 
    used to implement the URMQMF examples. 
    This new book is an expansion and adaptation of sections of the book  
    Haddon (2011) Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries
    <ISBN: 9781584885610>. URMQMF often goes beyond the examples in that 
    original book, although it does not include details on age-structured 
    or length-based models.
