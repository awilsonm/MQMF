\title{ssq a generalized function for summing squared residuals}
\usage{
ssq(par, funk, independent, observed, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{a vector of parameters used by funk}

\item{funk}{a function that uses par and indep to calculate
predicted values to compare with the dep values}

\item{independent}{a vector containing the independent variable
(x-axis) upon which the observed variable is assumed to be
dependent.}

\item{observed}{a vector containing the observed data (y-axis)}

\item{...}{required to allow funk to access its other parameters 
without having to explicitly declare them in ssq}
}
\value{
a single number (scaler) that is the sum of squared
    residuals between the dep values and those calculated by funk
}
\description{
ssq is a generalized function for summing squared
    residuals which is designed for ease of use in nlm (or
    optim, or nlminb). NAs are removed. It assumes the input of
    a predefined function 'funk' that will calculate predicted
    values of a 'dependent' variable from a vector of 'independent'
    values, for which one has observations. The predicted values
    are compared with the observed 'dependent data, and the
    resulting SSQ returned.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  data(minnow)
  pars <- c(89, 0.1,-13)  # ssq = 83477.84
  ssq(pars,vB,independent=minnow$week,observed=minnow$length)
}
