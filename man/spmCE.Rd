\title{spmCE - calculates the dynamics using a Schaefer or Fox model}
\usage{
spmCE(
  inp,
  indat,
  schaefer = TRUE,
  year = "year",
  cats = "catch",
  index = "cpue"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inp}{a vector of 2 or 3 model parameters (r,K) or (r,K,Binit), you
would use the latter if it was suspected that the fishery data 
started after some initial depletion had occurred.}

\item{indat}{a matrix with at least columns 'year', 'catch', and 'cpue'}

\item{schaefer}{a logical value determining whether the spm is to be a
simple Schaefer model (p=1) or approximately a Fox model (p=1e-08). 
The default is TRUE}

\item{year}{the column name within indat containing the years}

\item{cats}{the column name within indat containing the catches}

\item{index}{the column name within indat containing the cpue.}
}
\value{
a list of five objects; outmat the matrix with the dynamics 
    results, q catchability, msy the maximum sustainable yield, the 
    parameter values, and sumout, which contains r, K, B0, msy, p, q, 
    Depl, FinalB, and InitDepl
}
\description{
spmCE calculates the dynamics using a Schaefer of Fox model
    and is used instead of simpspm whenthere are multiple indeex vectors.
    The outputs include  predicted Biomass, year, catch, cpue, predicted
    cpue, contributions to q, ssq, and depletion levels. Generally it
    would be more sensible to use simpspm when fitting a Schaefer model 
    and simpfox when fitting a Fox model
    as those functions are designed to generate only the predicted cpue
    required by the functions ssq and negLLM, but the example shows how 
    it could be used. the function spm is used inside 'plotspmmod'
    and could be used alone, to generate a fullist of model outputs
    after the model has been fitted.
