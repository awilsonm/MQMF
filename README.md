# MQMF
An R package for the translation of Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries

To install from github it is most simple from inside RStudio using:
if (!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")} devtools::install_github("https://github.com/haddonm/MQMF")

I started a translation of an abridged version of my book Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries (Haddon, 2011). This is designed to introduce the materials needed to understand the use of R in fisheries sufficiently that when I write the more advanced book I have planned "Fisheries Modelling using R" along with its own R package, I will not have to include too much introductory material but can assume the reasder will know how to fit a model in R along with many other fundamental parsts of fsisheries population dynamics. The book will not really be for beginners but remains an introductory text because it covers such a wide array of subjects. Despite the breath of material sufficeint detail and worked examples are given that anyone should be able to make a good start with model fitting, characterizing uncertainty, and other basic fisheries model fitting.

This R package remains a draft of the what I hope will become a finsihed product in the not too distant future. When it is complete the intention is to work to have it accepted on CRAN.
