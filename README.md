# MQMF
An R package for the translation of Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries

In the text of the abbreviated R version of Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries R code is introduced but many functions are rather long and the intent of the book is not to teach R programming (especially as my code is designed to present an algorithm as clearly as I can rather than as elegantly (or obscurely) as I can. But I will try to add details in the function descriptions as part of the internal help.

Each chapter will finish with a listing of functions used and readers are exhorted to use "?" and examine the code by typing the function name with no brackets in the console.

There are intended to be sections relating to each of the chapters translated. Included is help for MQMF (?MQMF) that lists the data sets, and provides other details.
