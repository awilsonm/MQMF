An R package for the translation of Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries

I started a translation of an abridged version of my book Modelling and Quantitative Methods in Fisheries (Haddon, 2011). This is designed to introduce the materials needed to understand the use of R in fisheries sufficiently that when I write the more advanced book I have planned "Fisheries Modelling using R" along with its own R package, I will not have to include too much introductory material but can assume the reasder will know how to fit a model in R and how to run a simulation model.

This R package are very much a draft of the what I hope will become a finsihed product in the not too distant future.
